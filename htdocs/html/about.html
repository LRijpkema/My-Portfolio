    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p id="top">My name is Lulu Rijpkema, and I am currently pursuing a degree in software development. Prior to this, I studied Signage and Social Work. I realized I had been passionate about computers and creating my entire life and knew I wanted to learn how to program and I love doing this and I am really passionate about writing code and developing new things and I love learning all about coding and all the different languages and I believe this is what I want to do for the rest of my life.</p>

    <p id="bottom">When I was 18, I first saw videos of people teaching themselves how to code, and it encouraged me. However, I found it difficult to grasp the concepts, so I enrolled at a local college to study software development, where I am currently learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm currently evaluating everything I'm learning in order to determine what I enjoy the most and what I want to pursue afterward. After I finish my degree, I'm hoping to find a job where I can advance quickly.</p>
